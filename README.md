## Instructor: [Bilal Shahid][instructor url]


WordPress REST API is a new addition to the WordPress core and has the potential to change the way we interact with WordPress. With the REST API, we can build front-end web or mobile apps that harness the power and reliability of the WordPress CMS.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Bilal Shaid will teach you everything to need to know to get started using the WordPress REST API. You'll start by taking a look at some fundamental topics like HTTP, REST API, and JSON. Then you'll go on to experiment with the WordPress REST API with the Postman HTTP client. Finally, you will learn to use the REST API with jQuery to retrieve and create posts from a front-end web interface.
